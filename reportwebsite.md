Since I'm familiar with visual studio code I'm remotly working with it. Most of the time at this end of the session just git thoses sheet right away.

Btw I bought a brand new laptop that was a sickness to config with linux to make it work. First graphics driver problem that manage an unbootable ubuntu I had to add and "nouveau.modeset=0" next to quiet splash in the grub but it wasn't it all, I had to select the nvidia driver in the "Software" thing on ubuntu. The closing lib / hibernant / suspend messed me up aswell. So far the only solution to this was to disable lib closing thing and add "Xscreensaver" to the gnome-tweak.

Next to this anaconda messed up with me too with this rbash wich is the restricted bash. To resume while I was using the terminal trough vscode I couldn't run some python or whatever I would. I was restricted. So far aswell the only fix I had found was to install vscode trough anaconda.
